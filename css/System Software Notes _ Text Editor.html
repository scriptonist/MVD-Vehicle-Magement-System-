<h2> Text Editor </h2>

<h3> Introduction </h3>

A <i>text editor</i> is a tool that allows a user to create and revise
<i>documents</i> in a computer. Though this task can be carried out in other
modes, the word text editor commonly refers to the tool that does this
interactively. Earlier computer documents used to be primarily plain text
documents, but nowadays due to improved input-output mechanisms and file
formats, a document frequently contains pictures along with texts whose
appearance (script, size, colour and style) can be varied within the
document. Apart from producing output of such wide variety, text editors
today provide many advanced features of interactiveness and output.

<h3> Types of Text Editors </h3>

Depending on how editing is performed, and the type of output that can be
generated, editors can be broadly classified as -

<ol>
<li> Line Editors - During original creation lines of text are recognised and
delimited by end-of-line markers, and during subsequent revision, the line
must be explicitly specified by line number or by some pattern context. eg.
edlin editor in early MS-DOS systems.

</li><li> Stream Editors - The idea here is similar to line editor, but the entire
text is treated as a single stream of characters. Hence the location for
revision cannot be specified using line numbers. Locations for revision are
either specified by explicit positioning or by using pattern context. eg. sed
in Unix/Linux.
<p> Line editors and stream editors are suitable for text-only documents.

</p></li><li> Screen Editors - These allow the document to be viewed and operated upon
as a two dimensional plane, of which a portion may be displayed at a time.
Any portion may be specified for display and location for revision can be
specified anywhere within the displayed portion. eg. vi, emacs, etc.

</li><li> Word Processors - Provides additional features to basic screen editors.
Usually support non-textual contents and choice of fonts, style, etc.

</li><li> Structure Editors - These are editors for specific types of documents,
so that the editor recognises the structure/syntax of the document being
prepared and helps in maintaining that structure/syntax.
</li></ol>

<h3> Salient Aspects of Text Editor </h3>

A text editor has to cover the following main aspects related to document
creation, storage and revision -

    <ol>
    <li> Interactive user interface </li>
    <li> Appropriate format for storing the document in file in secondary
    storage </li>
    <li> Efficient transfer of information between the user interface and the
    file in secondary storage. </li>
    </ol>

<h4> Interactive user interface </h4>
An important consideration of a document is its layout to a human reader. For
this it is essential to present a document in a rectangular form, on the
monitor screen (terminal) or via a printer (as an output of the interactive
process). Further since a document can potentially be very large and since in
a computer terminal can display only a limited size of a document at a time,
hence it is necessary for a text editor to display only a portion
(<i>page</i>) of a large document that cannot be displayed in entireity at
once.

<p>
The process of creating and revising a document in a computer is called
<i>editing</i>. For interactive editing a text editor displays a document on
the terminal and accepts various types of input from the user through
different types of input devices, viz., keyboard, mouse, data-tablet (flat,
rectangular, elctromagnetically sensitive panel over which a
ball-point-pen-like stylus is moved and the coordinates of the stylus is sent
to the system).

</p><p>
Initially the text editor may display the starting portion of the document.
During editing the user may give inputs to bring other portions to the
display. Besides the displayed page, there is the notion of a point within
the page, indicated by an easily distinguishable symbol called the
<i>cursor</i>, where the next insertion, deletion or modification will be
effective. An editor provides various mechanisms (left-right-up-down keys,
page-up, page-down keys, mouse pointer, commands, etc.) for the
cursor to be moved throughout the document. If the user requires it to be
moved outside of the displayed page, the editor displays the new portion that
would contain the cursor. Many editors also allows the user to <i>select</i>
(and deselect) portions of the document whose attributes can be modified as a
whole (like change of font, delete, etc.)

</p><p>
The most basic action by a user in creating or revising a document is to type
in the text through the keyboard and, possibly, delete already typed
portions. Most text editors support many other features in order to reduce
the work of the user as well as to produce a higher quality documents.
Commonly found features include <i>cut-paste, pattern-search (and
substitute), font-change, working with multiple documents at the same time,
etc.</i>

</p><p>
Many text editors allows pictures and other non-text information to be
included in a document. Such editors provide mechanisms to either
create/modify such information or embed such objects inside the document.

</p><p>
The output of an editing process, i.e., the document, can be either
<i>saved</i> as <i>file(s)</i> in the secondary storage or sent to some
destination in the network, such as a printer or some remote host.


</p><h4> Appropriate format for storing the document in file in secondary
storage </h4>
The most natural way to visualise a document is as a planar layout of the
information, within some bounded space. Thus, one possible format to
<i>save</i> (store) the document in secondary storage is to save the
<i>attributes</i> of each visible point (pixel) by traversing the layout in
some order, say, left-to-right lines from top to bottom. However, this is not
the done for obvious reasons. For textual information, there are widely used
<i>code-sets</i> (eg., ASCII, EBCDIC, ISCII, Unicode, etc.) that are used to
encode the information. These code sets also contain codes for white spaces
and <i>new-line</i>, and hence most textual information can be conveniently
represented preserving the desired layout.

<p>
Many text editors allow the appearance (script, size, colour and style) of
text to be specified by the user. From the point of view of storing such
variations of appearance of text, this is usually achieved by storing extra
information describing the appearance along with the actual text. Thus in
secondary storage, the file corresponding to a document contains the textual
information as well as attributes of the text, sometimes called <i>meta
data</i>, that controls the appearance of the text in output medium.
Similarly, if the document has to contain non-textual information, that too
is embedded using suitable meta data.

</p><h4> Efficient transfer of information between the user interface and the
file in secondary storage. </h4>

The user interface of a text editor has to give emphasis to the visual
appearance of the portion of the document that is displayed at any time, and
convenience of the user to perform editing operations and viewing the
document. On the other hand the format in which the document is stored in the
secondary storage basically provides an unambiguous, static, and non-visual
model of the document. Thus the text editor has to convert the user input
into the file format, and file format into the display format. This
conversion is one of the basic requirements for the text editor design.

<h3> Structure of Text Editor </h3>

The structure of a text editor depends largely on the types of editing
features and displaying capabilities that are to be supported. To implement
the diplaying capabilities, the semantics of the meta data that may be
present in the document file needs to be implemented as display actions. For
example, if the meta data implies a particular colour to be used for a
segment of text, editor should invoke methods to effect that colour for the
particular segment of text. Since at a time only a finite portion of the
document can be displayed, such actions are to be taken for a portion of the
information in the file. However, the user may specify some other portion to
be displayed (through page-up, page-down, pattern search, etc.), in which
case the display actions must be performed for that portion. Thus the editor
program should keep track of the size of the display window, and the
boundaries of the current displayed portion in terms of offsets from some
fixed point in the document (such as line number of the first and the last
displayed lines, etc.)

<p>
It is not enough to directly produce the display of a document page from the
information in the file. The user provides different editing inputs which
implies changes in the displayed information as well as the document file.
For this, firstly, the editor should keep track of the cursor position with
respect to the displayed information. Then, one possible way to effect the
changes is to update the document file for each insertion, deletion or
modification input, and then redraw the page on the monitor according to the
changed content. But this is a very inefficient method. Instead, text editors
maintain a <i>memory image</i> of the document, and pages are displayed from
this memory image rather than from the document file. In fact, when a
document is being created, a corresponding file in the secondary storage may
not exist at all. All updations in the document due to editing inputs from
the user are effected in the memory image maintained in suitable
<i>buffers</i>.

</p><p>
The <i>choice of data structure</i> for the memory image (buffers) is
important, since it has to support <i>efficient insertion and deletion</i>,
while allowing the size of the document to vary from small to very large. A
simple 2-dimensional array wih each row containing a line of text, may not
suit for obvious reasons (what are the reasons ?). A linked list may
facilitate easy insertion and deletion, but having each letter in a single
node in the linked list may be wasteful of memory. Also, user commands such
as page-up, page-down, etc., may become inefficient. Thus some kind of
combination of array and linked list may have to be used. For example, the
entries of an array may point to individual buffers for each line of the
document. The buffer for a line may either be arrays or linked lists (with,
say, a word in each node). For very large documents it may not be a good idea
to hold the entire document in such buffers since only a small portion is
displayed at a time and editing operations for a reasonable duration are
likely to be in the neighbourhood of the displayed portion. In such
situations, a text editor may load only the required portion of the document
into memory buffers, but be able to load any other portion as and when
required.  It needs to be remembered that in the memory image too it is
essential to represent the meta data corresponding to the different portions
of the document.

</p><p>
By making use of the hardware features of the display terminals, it is
possible to avoid redrawing the entire screen for each editing input from the
user. For example, when a character is inserted in a line, only the portion
to the right of that position needs to be shifted. Similarly, when a line is
inserted or deleted, only the lines below that line are to be shifted. The
terminals provide easy alternatives for such actions. Moreover, modern
terminals provide more advanced buffering mechanisms such that the software
may only have to update the <i>display buffers</i>. Since the hardware
features vary from one product to another, there are certain software
standards and conversion libraries (for each kind of terminal) using which
the editor program may behave in hardware independent way (See <i>termcap</i>
and <i>terminfo</i> man pages in Unix/Linux).
